Personal Portfolio Site
Updated version: January 2024

Built upon past personal website models which were made using basic HTML/CSS/JS.
Previous versions were implemented using resources from W3schools. This new 2022 portfolio site implements Bootstrap and more reonsive frameworks beyond those of past years. Currently, involves bootstrap and some responsive frameworks. My intentions are to expand and implement Node.js as I continue to become more familiar with the technology.
